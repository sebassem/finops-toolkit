Azure Application Gateways are one of several types of [scalable and secure network services that Azure offers](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/overview). Typically, you choose an application gateway when you need advanced traffic management and web application firewall capabilities for your web applications.

An Azure Application Gateway provides a dedicated instance of a web traffic load balancer with Layer 7 routing, SSL termination, and web application firewall functionality. This allows you to manage and optimize the traffic to your web applications, ensuring they are secure, fast, and reliable. However, you still need to maintain the application gateway by performing tasks such as configuring rules, updating SSL certificates, and monitoring the gateway's performance.

```python
resources
| where type =~ 'Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways' and resourceGroup in ({ResourceGroup})
| extend backendPoolsCount = array_length(properties.backendAddressPools),SKUName= tostring(properties.sku.name), SKUTier= tostring(properties.sku.tier),SKUCapacity=properties.sku.capacity,backendPools=properties.backendAddressPools
| project id, name, SKUName, SKUTier, SKUCapacity
| join (
    resources
    | where type =~ 'Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways' and resourceGroup in ({ResourceGroup})
    | mvexpand backendPools = properties.backendAddressPools
    | extend backendIPCount = array_length(backendPools.properties.backendIPConfigurations)
    | extend backendAddressesCount = array_length(backendPools.properties.backendAddresses)
    | extend backendPoolName  = backendPools.properties.backendAddressPools.name
    | summarize backendIPCount = sum(backendIPCount) ,backendAddressesCount=sum(backendAddressesCount) by id
) on id
| project-away id1
| where  (backendIPCount == 0 or isempty(backendIPCount)) and (backendAddressesCount==0 or isempty(backendAddressesCount))

### Allocation

<!---
Add link to MS or F2 docs explaining the capability
-->

A highly effective method for grouping and allocating costs is through the tag inheritance feature in Cost Management. Enabled tag inheritance applies billing, resource group, and subscription tags to child resource usage records.

Once tag inheritance is enabled, tags from billing profiles, invoice sections, subscriptions, and resource groups are automatically applied to child resource usage records for the current month within 24 hours. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Cost allocation guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/enable-tag-inheritance).

#### Tagging best practices:

- **Consistent tagging:** Establish a consistent tagging strategy across VMs using the [Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-tagging).

Implementing tag inheritance and following these tagging best practices enhances your ability to efficiently allocate and manage VM costs.

### Reporting + analytics


<!---
TODO: Cost analysis has a feature where you can add a "cm-resource-parent" tag to your child resources (e.g., storage accounts) to link them to their logical parent and then Cost analysis will show the costs grouped together. We should inform them about this somewhere. It should be a separate doc that we reference probably in the reporting capability and possibly from here, if we end up calling out the issue.
-->


To report on VM costs comprehensively, consider all the services mentioned in the Data Ingestion capability, including but not limited to:

- **Virtual machines:** Understand the hourly billing, VM size, regional pricing, and states (running, stopped, deallocated).
- **Storage:** Factor in storage costs based on disk size and transactions per hour. 
- **Virtual network and bandwidth:** Include costs related to data transfer and bandwidth usage.
- **Associated services:** Consider costs associated with Azure Monitor, Azure Bastion, Azure DNS, and Load Balancer if used.

## Validating VM usage:

Once you've identified all the costs associated with a VM, the next crucial step is to validate the VM usage to ensure it is properly sized. This involves:

- **Right-sizing VMs:** Review the VM size to ensure it aligns with the actual workload requirements. Consider scaling up or down based on usage patterns.
- **Efficient resource management:** Leverage Azure services such as Cost Management and Azure Monitor to gain insights into VM performance metrics, allowing you to identify areas for optimization.


### Anomalies
