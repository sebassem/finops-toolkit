Cost Management tag inheritance allows you to apply subscription and resource group tags to cost details for all resources within those resource groups and subscriptions. Inherited tags are applied to resources even if the resource provider does not include resource tags in cost data.

Cost Management tag inheritance can be enabled for Enterprise Agreement and Microsoft Customer Agreement accounts.
